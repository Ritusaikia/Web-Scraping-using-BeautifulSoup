# Web-Scraping-using-BeautifulSoup
Web scraping the IMDB website for the most voted movies from the year 2000.

Web scraping is an essential tool to collect data from various web sources. I've created this repository for my first web scraping project.

I've referred this article (https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-beautifulsoup/) for the basic understanding of the process flow and tried to do as they did the scraping but their codes were not working most of the time. 
So, I've done most of the part by myself.

## Controlling the process
To control the extraction process, I've used the logic to run the program for a specific amount of user defined time. Or, one can do the controlling by monitoring the No. of requests that the process makes to the website which was done in the above mentioned article.
